```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

###5.40
```{r}
old.mu = 62; old.sigma = 18
studentA.old_score = 47
studentB.old_score = 90
studentA.z = (studentA.old_score - old.mu)/old.sigma
studentB.z = (studentB.old_score - old.mu)/old.sigma
studentA.z; studentB.z

new.mu = 75; new.sigma = 10
studentA.new_score = new.mu + studentA.z * new.sigma
studentB.new_score = new.mu + studentB.z * new.sigma
studentA.new_score; studentB.new_score
```

The new scores of the students who scored 47 and 90 would earn `r round(studentA.new_score, 2)` and `r round(studentB.new_score, 2)` respectively.

###5.41

```{r}
mean = 45; st_dev = 8

```
*(a)*


###6.24

```{r}
flight.mean = 0.8
flight.stderr = sqrt(0.8*(1-0.8)/400)
```
Since the standard error of the flight equates to being only 0.2, it is not likely that the flights will be within 0.03 of the true population proportion.
